<h3> Week 05 - Basic AngularJS</h3>

<p>
After doing well with jQuery and AJAX the previous week. I decided to work on Basics of AngularJS this week. Before starting the experiments, I read about AngularJS in w3schools and then I first experimented on "try it yourself". Later I read professor Jose's slides and I started my experiments.

<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week05/bind.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is my first AngularJS website. I binded the input text to a display element using directives.<br/> 
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week05/filter.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> I display a list of items as filter through them according to the input entered.<br />
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week05/diffbtn.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> I found out the button being clicked and displayed the button's name. <br />
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week05/selection.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> I made a list of courses that could be selected or dropped. </p>
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week05/multifilter.html" > <b>fifth experiment</b></a> I made a table which could be searched on each column.</p>

I feel confident on the Basics of AngularJS now, Next week I would like to work on deeper concepts of AngularJS.
