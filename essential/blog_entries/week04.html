<h3> Week 04 - jQuery and AJAX</h3>

<p>
After doing well with Bootstrap and Javascript the previous week. I decided to work on jQuery and AJAX this week. Before starting the experiments, I read about jQuery and AJAX in w3schools and then I first experimented on "try it yourself". Later I read professor Jose's slides and I started my experiments.
</p>
<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week04/sample.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is my first jquery website. I displayed some text using jquery functions.<br/> 
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week04/add.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> I dynamically appended the text below the input boxes.<br />
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week03/sortable.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> I sorted the list items using sortable() function of jQuery. 
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week04/toggle.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> I used toggle function of jquery to slide up and slide down some text. </p>

<p> Further, I continued working on AJAX in my <a href = "../../experiments/week04/ajax.html" > <b>fifth experiment.</b></a> 
where I worked on dynamically displaying data from a text file in an HTML page without reloading it. </p>
I feel confident on jQuery and AJAX now, Next week I would like to work on AngularJS.
