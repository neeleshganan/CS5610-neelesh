<h3> Week 09 - Project Experiments 1</h3>

<p>
My project idea was to make portfolio designer using Facebook API and LinkedIn API and to host the portfolios of registered users. Later on I changed my idea to work on MBTA Real Time API.

<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week09/exp1.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is the basic layout of how the portfolio would look like.<br/> 
In <a href = "../../experiments/week09/exp2.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> I used google maps API to show a specific location. I want to use this google maps widget to show my location the portfolio<br />
In <a href = "../../experiments/week09/exp3.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> I used Facebook graph API to login into facebook. To get the user's facebook data.<br />
In <a href = "../../experiments/week09/exp4.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> I changed my idea to MBTA. I used MBTA API to find out all the stops on red line. <br />
My <a href = "../../experiments/week09/exp5.html" > <b>fifth experiment</b></a> is about finding the users location. I want to use to this in my project to find out the nearest station to the user.</p>
