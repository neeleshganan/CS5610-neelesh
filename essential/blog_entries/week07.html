<h3> Week 06 - AngularJS : CRUD </h3>

<p>
After doing well with the CRUD operations of Angular JS the previous week. I decided to design an application in AngularJS this week.
</p>
<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week07/leave request 1.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is the basic form of leave request application.<br/> 
In <a href = "../../experiments/week07/leave request 2.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> I added a dependant dropdown box in the form.<br />
In <a href = "../../experiments/week07/leave request 3.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> I added dynamic input validations. <br />
In <a href = "../../experiments/week07/leave request 4.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> I added dynamic input fields. <br />
My <a href = "../../experiments/week07/leave request 5.html" > <b>fifth experiment</b></a> is about adding the summary of the form. </p>

I feel confident on the AngularJS CRUD operations now, Next week I would like to work on AngularJS Routing.
