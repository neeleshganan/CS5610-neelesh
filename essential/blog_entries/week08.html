<h3> Week 08 - Routing </h3>

<p>
After full fledged application using Angular JS the previous week. I decided to work on Routing this week.
</p>
<p>
The <a href = "../../experiments/week08/login.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is a basic login form which checks for validations<br/> 
In <a href = "../../experiments/week08/login1.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> each user is identified and his name is printed upon login.<br />
In <a href = "../../experiments/week08/login2.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> the user has the option to logout upon logging in. <br />
The <a href = "../../experiments/week08/route1.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> is a basic routing. <br />
Finally, the <a href = "../../experiments/week08/login3.html"> <b>fifth experiment</b></a> is a login form with routing and each user has his own profile.</p>

I feel confident on the Routing now, Next week I would like to work on experiments related to my projects.
