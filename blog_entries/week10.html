<h3> Week 10 - Project Experiments 2</h3>

<p>
I continued working on my project idea, The MBTA Real time API app.
</p>
<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week10/exp1.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> in this week is finding the nearest station of the user. <br/>
In <a href = "../../experiments/week10/exp2.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> I tried to insert and fetch data from mongo DB. I will use mongo DB in my project to stores the stops and their locations. <br />
In <a href = "../../experiments/week10/exp3.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> I used MBTA API to get the alerts about MBTA T. <br />
In <a href = "../../experiments/week10/exp4.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> I used MBTA API to get the details of the latest alert of MBTA.<br />
My <a href = "../../experiments/week10/exp5.html" > <b>fifth experiment</b></a> is about using the MBTA API to get the details of a specific station. </p>
