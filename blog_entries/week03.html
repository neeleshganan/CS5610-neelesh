<h3> Week 03 - Bootstrap and JavaScript</h3>

<p>
After doing well with CSS the previous week. I decided to work on Bootstrap and JavaScript this week. Before starting the experiments, I read about Bootstrap and JavaScript in w3schools and then I first experimented on "try it yourself". Later I read professor Jose's slides and I started my experiments.

<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week03/container.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is my first bootstrap website. I used container class in this site to align the contents of the page in order.<br/> 
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week03/grib.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> I made a grid using Bootstrap. Using grid we can align the contents of the HTML page as we like.<br />
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week03/carousel.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> I made a carousel of images using bootstrap. </p>

<p> Further, I continued working on JavaScript in my <a href = "../../experiments/week03/JSinput.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> and <a href = "../../experiments/week03/form.html" > <b>fifth experiment</b></a> 
where I worked on different inputs that can change the HTML page dynamically and also check the login credentials validation</p>
I feel confident on Bootstrap and JavaScript now, Next week I would like to work on AJAX and jQuery.
