<h3> Week 01 - HTML</h3>

<p>
This is my first blog. Before starting the experiments, I read about HTML in w3schools and then I first experimented on "try it yourself". Parallely I started to design my homepage.
</p>
<p>
This week I thought of working only on basic HTML and gain command over it first. 
<br>
In my <a href = "../../experiments/week01/static.html" >first experiment</a> I worked on all the possible static html tags like bold, italics, underline, lists and tables.
<br>
Later on I proceeded to make html page which can take inputs. My <a href = "../../experiments/week01/inputs.html" >second experiment</a> takes email, password, checkbox, radio button, color, date and time as inputs
<br>
Further, I continued working on <a href = "../../experiments/week01/anchor1.html" >Anchor tags,</a> <a href = "../../experiments/week01/frames.html" >frames,</a> and <a href = "../../experiments/week01/images.html" >maps in images.</a></p>
I feel confident on HTML now, Next week I would like to work on CSS.
