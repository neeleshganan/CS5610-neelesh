<h3> Week 06 - AngularJS : CRUD </h3>

<p>
After doing well with Basics of Angular JS the previous week. I decided to work on CRUD operations in AngularJS this week. Before starting the experiments, I learned about CRUD operations in AngularJS from Professor Jose Class's recording.
</p>
<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week06/bind.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is about retrieveing data from API.<br/> 
My <a href = "../../experiments/week06/bind1.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> is about being able to delete the items dynamically.<br />
My <a href = "../../experiments/week06/bind2.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> is about being able to add the items to favorites list dynamically. <br />
My <a href = "../../experiments/week06/bind3.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> is about being able to check the details of the items in favorites list. <br />
My <a href = "../../experiments/week06/bind4.html" > <b>fifth experiment</b></a> is about being able to search for the countries that played world cup dynamically. </p>

I feel confident on the AngularJS CRUD operations now, Next week I would like to work on AngularJS Routing.
