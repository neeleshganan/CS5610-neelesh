<h3> Week 02 - CSS</h3>

<p>
After doing well with HTML the previous week. I decided to work on CSS and Responsive pages this week. Before starting the experiments, I read about CSS in w3schools and then I first experimented on "try it yourself". Later I read professor Jose's slides and I started my experiments.
</p>
<p>
My <a href = "../../experiments/week02/inline.html" > <b>first experiment</b></a> is an inline css where the css was applied to each tag. This is not considered as a good way of designing so in my <a href = "../../experiments/week02/head.html" > <b>second experiment</b></a> I moved  all the css to &lt;head&gt; part of the html with &lt;style&gt; tag. This is also not considered a good way of designing so I created a separate css file in my <a href = "../../experiments/week02/separate.html" > <b>third experiment</b></a> and linked to the html using &lt;link&gt; tag. </p>

<p> Further, I continued working on responsive images in my <a href = "../../experiments/week02/media1.html" > <b>fourth experiment</b></a> and responsive navigation bar in <a href = "../../experiments/week02/nav-bar.html" > <b>fifth experiment</b></a> where the orientation of the navigation bar changes as the screen size is reduces to a specific size. This is done using @media screen which determines the screen size.</p>
I feel confident on CSS now, Next week I would like to work on Bootstrap.
